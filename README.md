# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
this is a branch of computer science that is used to test devlop and maintain software

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
masering process- it is the process of preparing and transferring recorded audio from a source containing the final mix to a data storage device.
mastering machine.
mastering complexity- it is the process breaking complex subjects down into digestible pieces through chunking.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- identifying the software requirments
design- building the framework
coding- changing the software design into a tangible code
testing- crosschecking th software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is linear and follows a sequence each phase is done after the previous is done 
agile methodology is incremental, with multiple cycles

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- develops programs applications and systems using programing languages and frameworks
Quality assuarance engineer collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirments
project manager- assembles and leads the software devvelopment team

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs assist coding error highlighting,debugging and autocomplition example is VSCode
VCS manages code changes, enables collaboration and tracks modifications. example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid technological changes wich can be overcomed by contious learning
Time constraints wich can be overcomed by agile methodologies called sprints
changing requirments wich can be overcomed by modular aproaches
Security risks wich can be overcomed by research and secure coding practices.
usability issues which can be overcomed by emphasizing user experience.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing , tests individual funftions 
intergretion testing, ensures diffrent modules work together
system testing , validates the entire system
acceptance testing, ensures software meets business/ user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering guides ai to generate better responses wich inturn improves user experience flexibility and developer control over ai interactions

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - 'write about climate change'
improved - ' write a 400 word article explaining the causes effects and possible solutions to climate change.
it has more clarity 
it has specific details
provides clear expectations
